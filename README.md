Course 3 Project Notes
The cord run_analysis.R begins with the Samsung data files and creates and output file measuring the means of certain fields
as described in more detail below.

This Readme file addresses how the code goes about meeting the requirments of the project.

The project looked for the following (as copied from the assignment):

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3 -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5 -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In order to run the code you must have access to the dplyr and reshape2 packages. The steps described below refer to the step
numbers from the project instructions.
